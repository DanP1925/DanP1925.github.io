To prepare for the new K2 compiler and how it will affect our current projects we have to understand how it works inside and what specific things are changing with the new compiler.

## What is a compiler

A compiler is a computer program that transforms source code into machine code.
In particular, the Kotlin language can convert kt files into JVM bytecode, Javascript, or LVVM bytecode.

When we are talking about the Kotlin compiler, we can divide the work it does into two phases the Frontend and the Backend

### Frontend

The Frontend is in charge of converting the source code into two different structures: the **syntax tree** and the **semantic info**

#### Syntax Tree

The syntax tree organize the elements of the source code to represent the relationships between the variables and the keywords.
At this moment in time, the variables don't know what value are inside them, the only important part is the relationship between al the elements.

#### Semantic Info



### Backend

## How this will impact the Android projects
